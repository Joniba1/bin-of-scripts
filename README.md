# Overview

A collection of scripts I use frequently, including both **Bash scripts** for Linux and **Batch scripts** for Windows.

---

## Setting Up

### Windows

1. Add the path of the `scripts/batch/` folder to your **`PATH`** environment variable.
2. After that, you can run any batch script from any terminal or command prompt.

### Linux

1. Add the path of the `scripts/bash/` folder to your **`PATH`** environment variable.
2. Ensure all Bash scripts are executable. You can do this by running:

```bash
chmod +x /path/to/scripts/bash/*
```
